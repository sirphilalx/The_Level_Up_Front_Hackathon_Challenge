# The Level Up Front Hackathon Challenge

## Introduction

The Level Up Front Hackathon Challenge was put up by Frantz Kati, a seasoned senior dev for frontend devs. The aim of the challenge is to make frontend devs students and enthusiasts to see what the challenge is in the real world so that the approach to learning will be very realistic to meet the demands of the industry.

## About Shopify

The Hackathon challenge is a Figma design that you have to bring to life as a frontend engineer. The Figma design is an exact replica of the Shopify onboarding dashboard. This is the dashboard that is used by Shopify's 1.75 million merchants to sell millions in ecommerce products.

You are welcome to start immediately, and submit your solution before the 27th Nov.

Before you proceed, please watch the 5 min video below for an introduction to the entire challenge:

Shopify is a user-friendly e-commerce platform that helps small businesses build an online store and sell online through one streamlined dashboard. As a business, they strive to provide great user experiences to all their users, including keyboard-only users, visually impaired users

## My Challenge

My challenge was to build the merchant onboarding experience as per the Figma design provide to me. I catered for the three most popular types of Shopify merchants:

1. Mouse users
2. Keyboard-only users
3. Screen reader users

I had to create a fully responsive experience for users on these device types:

1. Mobile Phones (Google Chrome Browser Only)
2. Desktops (Google Chrome Browser Only)

To complete this challenge, I assumed I work as a software engineer at Shopify, assigned to complete this project, so as to provide a great dashboard experience to Shopify merchants.

## The Challenge Resource

1. Figma File

Here's the Figma file for this challenge. We recommend that you duplicate this Figma design to your own Figma drafts.

2. Icons and Images

## Challenge and Constraints

I considered the following constraints as I created my solution to the challenge:

I used 3 HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript for the challenge. No CSS or Javascript frameworks or libraries are allowed.

I used 3 files for my solution: index.html for my HTML, app.css for my CSS and app.js for my Javascript.

I made sure every text I used is exactly as displayed on the Figma design. I did not use different text because the text will be used for your automatic submission evaluation.

## User Stories

This is a list of acceptance criteria to consider your solution to this challenge as complete. Please take a moment to study the Figma designs before reading this, so it makes sense as you read.

- As a merchant, when I click on the Shopify icon on the top bar, I am taken to the shopify landing page shopify.com

- As a merchant, when I focus on the search box on the top bar, I can freely type into the input. At the moment, no further actions or results should occur. A merchant should only be able to type freely in the box.

- As a merchant, when I click on the notification bell, I see a dropdown panel that shows me an empty list of notifications since I have none yet. When I click on the notification bell again, this dropdown panel is closed.

- As a merchant, when I click on the name of my store Davii Collections, or on my profile image placeholder DC on the far right of the topbar menu, I see a menu with a list of menu items as specified by the Figma design. Clicking on this button again closes the menu. Finally, when I click on any of the menu items in this menu, I am redirected toadmin.shopify.com

- As a merchant, when I click on theSelect plan link, I am redirected to the Shopify pricing page atshopify.com/pricing

- As a merchant, when I click on the dismiss button of the trial callout, the trial callout is immediately removed from the page.

- As a merchant, when I click the "Arrow Up" icon on the top right of the Setup guide card, it closes the card. When I click again, it reopens the card.

- As a merchant, when I click on any of the 5 onboarding steps, it expands the panel, showing the content of the onboarding step, and closes the previously opened one. When I click on an opened onboarding step, nothing happens.

- As a merchant, when I click on the circle checkbox (empty) on the left side of an onboarding step title, it marks that step as completed, and expands the next incomplete step. If I click again, it marks the step as incomplete. As I mark steps as completed or incomplete, I see the onboarding progress bar showing the correct progress.
